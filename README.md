# Sentiment-Analysis-of-User-Reviews
Analyse customer reviews of the Netflix app

## Techniques Employed
   * Sampling from imbalanced datasets using the imbalanced-learn package
   * Enquiring about the sentiment value of the reviews with the dictionary-based sentiment analysis tools, which are part of NLTK, a natural language processing toolkit, used in Python.
   * Analyzing the reviews with a state-of-the-art deep learning technique, namely with the DistilBERT model. To build this model, you will need to run Pytorch, transformers, and the simpletransformers packages.
   * Evaluating your model and creating descriptive statistics in Python with scikit-learn library.
